# Sublime Markdown Tips

Note that these instructions are based on use of Sublime plugins around 2017. These may have updated and the Sublime's builtin functionality around markdown may have changed.

1. See this article on [How to setup markdown previewing in Sublime](http://plaintext-productivity.net/2-04-how-to-set-up-sublime-text-for-markdown-editing.html). 
2. Install both _Markdown Editing_ and _Markdown Preview_.
3. Keyboard shortcuts (in Linux):
    - `ALT M` to preview `.md` file in your browser.
    - `CTRL B` for build command, to render a `.md` file as `.html` file in the same directory.
    - `CTRL SHIFT P` then to find things you can do e.g. search "Preview"
